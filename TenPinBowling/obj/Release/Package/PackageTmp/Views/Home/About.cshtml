<p>ATG Media need an application to help them keep track of their bowling scores during a game. The system needs to keep score for any number of players and should display a score card and name for each player on screen at the end of the game.</p>
<p>A game consists of ten frames, which start with a full rack of ten pins. In each frame, you have two deliveries of your ball, in which to knock down as many of the ten pins as you can.</p>
<p>If you knock down all the pins on your first ball, it is called a strike. The score doesn't get added on straight away because for a strike you get the values of your next two balls as a bonus. For example, if you score a strike in the first frame, then a 7 and 1 in the second frame, you would score 18 (10+7+1) for the first frame, and 8 for the second frame, making a total of 26 after two frames.</p>
<p>If you knock down some of the pins on the first ball, and knock down the remainder of the pins in the second ball, it is known as a spare. Again, the score doesn't get added on straight away because for a spare, you get the values of your next ball as a bonus. For example, if you score a spare in the first frame, say a 6 and a 4, then got an 8 and a 1 in the second frame, you would score 18 (6+4+8) for the first frame, and 9 for the second frame, making a total of 27 after two frames.</p>
<p>When it comes to the final frame, it is slightly different. In the final frame, you get bonus balls if you strike or spare, to a maximum of three deliveries. If you strike in the first delivery you have the opportunity to strike in the remaining two and have three deliveries in total. If you scored strikes in each of your final three deliveries, the score for the final frame would be 30 (10+10+10). If you spare the final frame, you get the third delivery as a bonus. So, a spare, 9 and 1, followed by a strike would equal 20 (9+1+10).</p>
<p>When the program starts it will ask for the number of players and then each player for their name. The system shall prompt each player in turn to enter the number of pins knocked down after each bowl. Something like “Player Name, please enter your score for bowl 2 of frame 4” will suffice. Any invalid characters should not be accepted. After a player has bowled a frame their score card so far should be displayed.</p>
<p>Each large box represents a frame, the two numbers at the top of the box are the scores for the first and second bowl, the current score after the frame has been played appears at the bottom. A strike should be represented as an “X” a spare as a “/”. The card can be rendered using ASCII and extended ASCII characters or HTML (if building a website).</p>
<p>When the game is finished the system should declare the winner and display each player’s card in rank order.</p>
